# .NET 6 WebAssembly + WebGL

This is a minimum viable product for running WebGL, using dotnet6's BlazorWebassembly and WaveEngine's OpenGLES with emscripten, based on @emepetres's wasm sample projects.

## Areas needing work

While running and debugging the project works, publishing (deploys) are not functional in this sample, in that a simple CDN can serve the project. If anyone knows how to fix this, I'm all all ears!
